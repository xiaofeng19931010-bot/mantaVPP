mechanism
Omit rule 3.10B, including the heading and the note, and substitute:
3.10B Voluntarily scheduled resource incentive mechanism
3.10B.1 Definitions
In this rule 3.10B:
external funding means any funding, grant or other financial support from
a party other than AEMO (including from a government funding body or
regulator) to meet part or all of AEMO’s costs of implementing the VSR
incentive mechanism, including to meet any participation payments.
incentive MW price cap is the price (in $/MW) determined by AEMO
which must be less than the VSR Benefits (calculated in $/MW) that AEMO
expects will accrue from successful VSR incentive mechanism participants
participating in central dispatch, in relation to a particular VSR tender
process.
incentive period means the period from 1 April 2026 to 31 December 2031.
participation payment means the amount (in $) payable under a VSR
participation agreement.
participation price means the amount (in $/MW) payable under a VSR
participation agreement, which is to be determined in accordance with
clause 3.10B.2(f)(1).
VSR Benefits means the expected benefits to consumers as a whole of
voluntarily scheduled resources participating in central dispatch, including
where the participation results in reduced system security services costs,
avoided generation, avoided greenhouse gas emissions and reduced RERT
costs.
VSR incentive objective is to maximise VSR Benefits in the long run by
incentivising Market Participants with qualifying resources to nominate
those resources as voluntarily scheduled resources, while minimising the
cost of facilitating participation through participant payments.
VSR incentive principles means the principles for the VSR incentive
mechanism listed in clause 3.10B.2(e).
3.10B.2 Design and conduct of VSR incentive mechanism
(a) During the incentive period, AEMO must conduct at least two VSR
tender processes.
33

National Electricity Amendment (Integrating price-responsive resources into the NEM) Rule 2024 No.

24
(8) the requirements for VSR participation agreements and any
standard form VSR participation agreement.
(e) The VSR incentive principles are that the VSR incentive mechanism
should be structured and run in a way that achieves the VSR incentive
objective, taking into consideration:
(1) the relative availability of voluntarily scheduled resources
having regard to expected capacity factors and any planned
hibernation notices under clause 3.10A.2;
(2) the extent to which each voluntarily scheduled resource is
expected to vary its generation or consumption in response to
expected spot prices; and
(3) the benefits of building capability across a number of
Voluntarily Scheduled Resource Providers with a variety of
voluntarily scheduled resources (including in relation to
aggregation) in order to have multiple Voluntarily Scheduled
Resource Providers with a diversity of resources participating
in central dispatch.
